# The Bryte Alliance: Cogitate Connectivity Challenge 2024

Please find here all code needed to replicate our analysis that formed the basis for our initial preregistration report.

Code can be run in the following order:
```
Step1_Run_Preprocessing.sh
Step2_Compute_Connectivity_Statistics.sh
Step3_Fit_Classifiers.sh
```

Users can then interact directly with the visualization code found in `Step4_Visualize_Batch1_Results.ipynb`.

Note: Code in this repository requires scripts in [@anniegbryant's modified fork](https://github.com/anniegbryant/cogitate-msp1) from the Cogitate Main Scientific Paper (MSP1) repository for preprocessing MEG data, which can be cloned with the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/anniegbryant/cogitate-msp1.git
```
